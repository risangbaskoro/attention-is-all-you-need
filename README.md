# Attention is All You Need

> The Tensorflow Implementation of Attention is All You Need paper.

This is the basic implementation of the paper [Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) in Tensorflow. 

The repository is intended to be an educational purposes, and not to be used in production. The code is not optimized for speed, and it is not intended to be. The code is optimized for readability and it is intended to be used as a starting point for students who want to learn about the Transformer model.
